## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I develop intelligent systems with a strong emphasis on practical impact and scalability. With experience spanning high-growth startups and multinational corporations, I have delivered AI solutions across NLP, Computer Vision, and Voice AI. I build efficient, domain-specific models tailored to business needs - using both Gen AI and traditional ML algorithms.

#### Model Building
Built and fine-tuned domain specific models for various domain-specific tasks
 - Full finetuning, LoRA, QLoRA
 - Text classification: ModernBert, Bert, DistilBert
 - Image classification: YOLO, ViT
 - Custom NER modeling
 - Full document classification

#### Multi-modal RAG systems
For virtual assistant, document QA
 - Document parsing, chunking 
 - Semantic search, keyword search, FAISS+HNSW, vector DBs
 - Re-ranker, LLMs

#### Voice AI systems:
For virtual assistants
 - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
 - Speaker diarization using agglomerative clustering
 - Voice cloning (Coqui TTS, Tortoise TTS, and ElevenLabs)

#### Document understanding
For downstream tasks like RAG, classification etc
 - Text parsing
 - Image and diagram extraction
 - Text extraction from images ( OCR)

#### Curating High Quality Dataset: 
For training, evaluation and benchmarking models
 - Curation of high quality custom real-world data
 - High quality synthetic data generation using LLMs
 - Data labelling, augmentation using LLMs
 - Data wrangling, visualization and analysis

#### Responsible AI: 
For responsible and safe AI usage
 - Red teaming LLMs: Created frameworks and then built datasets to evaluate LLMs for bias (against protected classes)
 - AI Audit: Creating SOPs for clients to ensure their AI development meets legal, ethical, and regulatory compliance.
 - Working on PII detection and custom NER modeling

### Tech:

### Individual Contributor & Team Player:
Comfortable working as an individual collaborator, having developed multiple models for domain-specific enterprise use cases. Also thrive in collaborative environment - wisdom of crowds is always a strength.

### Leadership Skills:
With proven leadership skills, I have successfully managed small teams, overseeing their daily tasks and facilitating KT. I have led development and production teams for an ahead-of-schedule DataStage version upgrade.
